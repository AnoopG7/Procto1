**Q: How sensitive is the monitoring system?**
A: The system is calibrated to detect genuine security concerns while minimizing false positives. Brief, innocent activities typically won't trigger violations.

**Q: Can I have notes or books during the exam?**
A: This depends on your instructor's exam settings. Some exams are open-book while others are closed-book. Check your exam instructions.

**Q: What happens if I'm flagged for a violation?**
